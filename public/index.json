In NBS-Predict, we combine Network-based Statistics (Zalesky et al., 2010) and feature engineering for connectome-based prediction. Briefly, NBS-Predict allows identifying graph components with associated prediction accuracies by combining a graph theory with machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machine, decision tree) in a cross-validation structure. Additionally, NBS-Predict comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) that does not require any programming expertise. As such, it allows for a broad audience of researchers to potentially benefit from advanced but easy to interpret machine-learning applications to facilitate the search for biomarkers.\n","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"55cfe20cd11e28e6fcc8f1ccf711812c","permalink":"https://eminserin.github.io/project/nbs-predict/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nbs-predict/","section":"project","summary":"The prediction-based extension of Network-based Statistic","tags":null,"title":"NBS-Predict","type":"project"},{"authors":["Emin Serin","Ece Onder","Asli Deniz Senol","Burak Erdeniz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527800400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527800400,"objectID":"fdbf9943eb1f40c10e136e111fd3d16e","permalink":"https://eminserin.github.io/publication/serin_et_al_2018/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/serin_et_al_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous studies have shown that natural environments such as forests have a facilitative influence on reducing the stress level of individuals. The empirical research has also revealed that such restorative impacts on humans appear in three different responses that are emotional, physiological, and cognitive (Ulrich et al., 1991). The purpose of the current study is to examine the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Short-version Revised Restoration Scale (Han, 2003). The scale consists of 8 items. Each 2 item is associated with one of four dimensions, which are cognitive, physiological, emotional, and behavioral. Based on the original study of Han (2003), 48 colored slides, which were cat- egorized into six major different biomes; desert, tundra, tropic forest, coniferous forest, deciduous forest and grassland were used. The Turkish version of the Short-version Revised Restoration Scale (RS) were applied to 118 undergraduate students in the city of Izmir. In the second study conducted, the Short-version Revised Restoration Scale was applied to 145 university students using the Turkish Ecological Photograph Stimulus Set (TEFUS), which was developed to provide a visual stimulus set for experimental ecological psychology research. In the second study, the two-factor structure accounts for over % 80 of the total variance. Finally, these two studies that have been conducted found a two-factor solution to SSRS scale, despite the four-factor solution to be the original scale. The reasons for the differences in the number of factors occurring between the current research and the previous researches were discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Turkish Version of Short-version Revised Restoration Scale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Burak Erdeniz","Emin Serin","Yelda Ibadi","Cumhur Tas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514581200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514581200,"objectID":"88fdc4b50f84a606245f2d9b51d67762","permalink":"https://eminserin.github.io/publication/erdeniz_et_al_2017/","publishdate":"2017-12-30T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/erdeniz_et_al_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Schizophrenia is a complex disorder in which abnormalities in brain connectivity and social functioning play a central role. The aim of this study is to explore small-world network properties, and understand their relationship with social functioning and social cognition in the context of schizophrenia, by testing functional connectivity differences in network properties and its relation to clinical behavioral measures. Resting-state fMRI time series data were acquired from 23 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 23 healthy volunteers. The results revealed that patients with schizophrenia show significantly decreased connectivity between a range of brain regions, particularly involving connections among the right orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral putamen and left amygdala. Furthermore, topological properties of functional brain networks in patients with schizophrenia were characterized by reduced path length compared to healthy controls; however, no significant difference was found for clustering coefficient, local efficiency or global efficiency. Additionally, we found that nodal efficiency of the amygdala and the putamen were significantly correlated with the independence-performance subscale of social functioning scale (SFC), and Reading the Mind in the Eyes test; however, the correlations do not survive correction for multiple comparison. The current results help to clarify the relationship between social functioning deficits and topological brain measures in schizophrenia.","tags":[],"title":"Decreased Functional Connectivity in Schizophrenia: The Relationship Between Social Functioning, Social Cognition and Graph Theoretical Network Measures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Baris Metin","Ayse Goktepe","Bernis Kaya","Emin Serin","Cumhur Tas","Fatmanur Dolu","K.

While studies generally focused on qualitative data of flow state, a few were conducted on psychophysiological basis of it. Present study aimed to investigate EEG correlates of flow. Twenty participants preliminarily filled out Flow Short Scale Turkish Version and completed a ping-pong game at two levels (slow-boring and fast-flow) during EEG recording. The results revealed that theta power was significantly greater for all regions during flow condition compared to non-flow condition and delta power was significantly greater during flow on central and parietal regions. There is no difference between flow/non-flow conditions for coherence. A positive correlation was found between delta and theta powers and subscales scores of Flow Short Scale. The increases in these theta and delta frequency bands could be important indicators of flow state. The coherence results revealed that interhemispheric synchronization was not modified by flow. If confirmed with multiple tasks and in clinical groups, EEG correlates of flow state could be useful increase performance and well-being.","tags":[],"title":"EEG findings during flow state","type":"publication"}]
