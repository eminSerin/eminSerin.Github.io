abstract = "Previous studies have shown that natural environments such as forests have a facilitative influence on reducing the stress level of individuals. The empirical research has also revealed that such restorative impacts on humans appear in three different responses that are emotional, physiological, and cognitive (Ulrich et al., 1991). The purpose of the current study is to examine the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Short-version Revised Restoration Scale (Han, 2003). The scale consists of 8 items. Each 2 item is associated with one of four dimensions, which are cognitive, physiological, emotional, and behavioral. Based on the original study of Han (2003), 48 colored slides, which were cat- egorized into six major different biomes; desert, tundra, tropic forest, coniferous forest, deciduous forest and grassland were used. The Turkish version of the Short-version Revised Restoration Scale (RS) were applied to 118 undergraduate students in the city of Izmir. In the second study conducted, the Short-version Revised Restoration Scale was applied to 145 university students using the Turkish Ecological Photograph Stimulus Set (TEFUS), which was developed to provide a visual stimulus set for experimental ecological psychology research. In the second study, the two-factor structure accounts for over % 80 of the total variance. Finally, these two studies that have been conducted found a two-factor solution to SSRS scale, despite the four-factor solution to be the original scale. The reasons for the differences in the number of factors occurring between the current research and the previous researches were discussed."
